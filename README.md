# llm-minify

## Goals
- Minimize the number of tokens a file requires for GPT4 to understand it
- Change the form so it is best understood by GPT4 (anecdotally it seems $\text{JSON} > \text{XML} > \text{RON}$)
  - this makes sense given GPT4 was probably trained on a lot of JSON

## Supported Files

- [x] SVD
- [ ] XML
- [ ] JSON
- [ ] CSV
